Smart-Fan
=========

Yet another fan project...

# Projects

## Analog
Simple analog fan controller (on/off) using a TMP35.

## Case Cooling
Smart fan controller using tachometer feedback and either PWM (4-pin) or voltage control (3-pin) and a variety of temperature sensors (analog, 1-wire, etc.).  Used to provide automatic temperature control for things like my printer enclosure for air circulation, inlet air control, etc.
